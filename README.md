## General Information
- The code is written python doing a EDA of loans issued by a Lending Club. 
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- the dataset used is included in the repository

## Conclusions
- 5627 are the number of defaulters
- Loan grade B, C, D and E together contributed to 80% of the amount to be recovered.
- Even in terms of numbers, these four categories contribute the numbers
- The loan purpose of “dept-consolidation” is the bar standing out, both in terms of number of defaulters and the amount they defaulted, across all grades.
- the “dept-consolidation” and "credit-card" purpose have higher dti.
- The properties that are on “Rent” or “Mortgage” is the bar standing out, both in terms of number of defaulters and the amount they defaulted, across all grades.
- The people having experience less than a year or more than 10 years, have defaulted more.
- Majority of the amount defaulted is in the range of 1000 to 15000
- Surprisingly, the “Verified” sources of income had higher number of defaulters under different percentile. Even the outliers amount are more for Verified sources.
